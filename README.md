These are various tools that I install into my `$PATH` that I find useful.

## `compress_cwd`

This compressed the value of `$PWD` so that it's not too long. I use this as an
alternative to `\w` in my prompt.

## `gocd`

This efficiently searches `$GOPATH` to find a Go project.

## `loaded_keys`

This prints out what SSH keys I have loaded in a form suitable to put in my
prompt.
